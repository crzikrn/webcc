# Learning Web Design & Development through Creative Coding - Beginner's Course
-
Hello, and welcome to *learning web designing & development through creative coding*. This course is an introduction to web designing taught by a designer. This is NOT a course for DOM handling, but a beginner's course on Web Design by first embedding the concept of computer languages by creative coding. It's a mouthful right?

## Reasons for developing this course
-
Many times beginners are pushed away from learning web designing for the heavy emphasis in learning HTML & CSS without really understanding anything about communications with a computer. There is no introduction to conceptual framework. The format of teaching computer languages of any complexity is largely focused in memorizing syntax. No wonder many people are turned off. It's boring and there is no sense of purpose.

When you learn a new language like French, you learn it because perhaps you want to go to France. You don't go to a computer country, so the purpose of learning web should be clear. Second, it's easier to grasp a language when you have context, like a dialogue, saying hello, asking names, asking where the bathroom is. These are complete phrasess


I wanted to move away from the traditional teaching method of programming. Instead of going through the basic essentials and the bare bones building blocks of programming, I wanted to start with a hands on approach like when a kid learns to draw by just giving them crayon and paper.
