# Learning Web Design & Development through Creative Coding - Beginner's Course PART 1

Hello, and welcome to *learning web designing through creative coding*. This course is an introduction to web designing taught in designer perspective. This is NOT a course for DOM handling, but a beginner's course on Web Design. I focus on embedding the concept of computer languages simply doing. Doing in creative coding. Sounds counter-intuitive right?

## Reasons for developing this course

Many times beginners are pushed away from learning web designing for the heavy emphasis in learning HTML & CSS. There is no concrete plausibility in learning the basics first for better understanding web designing. You really start without understanding anything about communications with a computer. There is no *fun* introduction to the conceptual framework of web design. I mean, considering HTML to be a sort of a computer communications tool, most format of teaching communications with computers of any complexity is largely focused in memorizing syntax. No wonder many people are turned off. It's boring and there is no sense of purpose.

So for this class we will simply jump into making things. If you aren't going to understand it anyway, why don't you have fun while at it?

I wanted to move away from the traditional teaching method of web development. Instead of going through the basic essentials and the bare bones building blocks of HTML & CSS, I wanted to start with a hands on approach like when a kid learns to color by just giving them a crayon and a coloring book. And so we start with creative coding, to learn web.

## What is required

Just be you. I'll make the coloring book you just *crayon*. Don't fret it. We will learn by asking questions and simply wanting to do more. Essential be ready to ask questions and wanting to take the next step. All the answers are prepared.

## What you can expect
Hopefully, I get you to understand what it means to communicate with a computer first. Since this is originally an offline class, I'll be present in the classroom to guide the understanding of computer communications. If you want to be technical, we will use already made templates (coloring book) on **codepen.io** and start going wild. Afterwards, I'll do the traditional way of teaching the basics of web designing (the 90s way!)

# Projects

There is basically 3 projects for the first section.
- Creating your own brush stroke
- Making a brush pattern
- Making a brush algorithm

What does all this mean? We're learning to make our own brushes; we will draw with our brush; and finally we will make the computer draw with our brush. Simple as that.

# Template Links
Let's get started! Here are a few methods to get started. All will be explained, just choose one of the many ways.

## Web Editor for p5.js
Best would be to just go HERE! (https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/) And Do our projects here :) It's in alpha version so beware! 

## Codepen.io
If you want to save what you did, you can either make an account at https://codepen.io and fork the empty template for a p5.js, I'll explain everything in class so don't freak out!

## Code Editor
And if you are adventurous enough we can learn the ways to do it on our computers with a code editor. I'll go around and do a 1:1 tutorial for this. However, be ready to already have a code editor. Atom[https://atom.io/], Brackets[http://brackets.io/], Sublime[https://www.sublimetext.com/], to name a few.

# Class Excercies
No matter where you go, there will be always Homework. Oh, the dread! It's the best way to learn though.

## Class 01 - Learning what Coding is... then make a Paint App.
What!? We just learned what "coding" meant, how can we make an app right away? Well, just listen carefully to what I have to say. There's no need to scare off beginners, at all means we have to invite with open arms. It *IS* super easy to make a functional app, it just ain't perfected yet. So yeah, within 10 minutes of your first lecture you have your own paint app, how amazing is that?

## Class 02 - We can digitally paint, now what? Let's be Media Artists!
Digital tools are awesome because... well we create awesomeness with minimalism. It's like magic. Computer magic. What shamanism is this!? I expect our class to be media artists by the end of class :)

## Class 03 - Humans drawing is old news, let's make the computer do our work.
Have you ever wondered why we made computers? Sometimes, I think we made them just to slack off. So let's be media artists that make the computer do the work! Now we are creative technology artists, we sure are growing fast.

## Class 04 - Now a bit of seriousness. Finally, we get to use our thinking!
Seldom I like to just drift in my thoughts, and that's what we'll do. Think. Anyways, our creative coding class is coming to an end :(, and I will start explaining the connections of computer communcations and web designing. A bit of history and my personal thoughts on why we humans go nuts for making webpages.

## Class 05 - Goodbye Coding and Hello Web Design.
We are going to watch a video from 1968 called the "Mother of All Demos" if you want to go check it out beforehand be my guest! [MOTHER OF ALL DEMOS LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY)
